# simply-divine

A simple CSS and HTML portfolio website to give potential employers a taster of my work.

## Overview
* When the page is loaded you will see my name, an avatar and navigation links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my projects or applications.
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application or a project website.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport
